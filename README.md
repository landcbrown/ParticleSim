# ParticleSim
WIP object oriented particle simulator written in java utilizing swing for visualization

This is my first project in a while and my first one on github; I'm working on this with the goal of re-familiarizing myself with object orineted design as well as coding in general. I hope that this will be the first of many simulations I write!

Note: the main method is ParticleSimulator.java
